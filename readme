******Known Issues*********************************
You cannot use the add .zip library when downloading this library: https://github.com/jacob1421/Twitch-IRC-API/tree/master/Twitch_IRC_API
You must add the Twitch_IRC_API folder to your arduino/libraries folder

If you have issue completeing this step, and the files within Twitch_IRC_API to your local file folder, and make the includes local, for example:

change this from 
#include <bot_credentials.h>
#include <memory_constraints.h>
#include <twitch_irc_api.h>

to
#include "bot_credentials.h"
#include "memory_constraints.h"
#include "twitch_irc_api.h"

***During the recent Twitch update (25MAY2020) you can no longer get the reward ID as shown 
in the Tutorial video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WV1r6HaXaPY&t=118s). 

A work around is to upload example code like this https://github.com/noycebru/twitch-websockets-for-channel-point-robots/blob/master/servo%20example
to your device and connect it to your Twitch account. Then create your custom channel point. Then while you have everything connected 
and the serial monitor open activate the channel point you created. The channel point reward ID will populate in serial monitor.

***This code is also dependent on the ArduinoWebsockets library. Please be sure to include that in your sketch. ***
you include this by going to Arduino IDE and selecting library manager, search for ArduinoWebsockets and install that library. 

**MUST HAVE REQUIRE TEXT SELECTED ON FOR CHANNEL POINTS**
