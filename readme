***During the recent Twitch update (25MAY2020) you can no longer get the reward ID as shown 
in the Tutorial video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WV1r6HaXaPY&t=118s). 

A work around is to upload example code like this https://github.com/noycebru/twitch-websockets-for-channel-point-robots/blob/master/servo%20example

to your device and connect it to your Twitch account. Then create your custom channel point. Then while you have everything connected 
and the serial monitor open activate the channel point you created. The channel point reward ID will populate in serial monitor. ***

***If you have issues adding the Twitch IRC library as a zip file you will have to add it to your Arduino library folder manually.***
***This code is also dependent on the ArduinoWebsockets library. Please be sure to include that in your sketch. ***
The above examples were created using this code developed by jacob1421  https://github.com/jacob1421/Twitch-IRC-API 

**MUST HAVE REQUIRE TEXT SELECTED ON FOR CHANNEL POINTS**

Must download all of these files for this to work: https://github.com/jacob1421/Twitch-IRC-API/tree/master/Twitch_IRC_API
if the download zip does not work, you may have to insert this library manually into your arudino libraries folder

All functions can be seen here if my examples are missing a function you'd like to use:

To add SSID and Password to bot_credintials.h file please copy and paste the following:

#define WIFI_SSID "" 
#define WIFI_PASS ""
