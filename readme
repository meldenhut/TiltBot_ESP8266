The above examples were created using this code developed by jacob1421  https://github.com/jacob1421/Twitch-IRC-API 

**MUST HAVE REQUIRE TEXT SELECTED ON FOR CHANNEL POINTS**

Must download all of these files for this to work: https://github.com/jacob1421/Twitch-IRC-API/tree/master/Twitch_IRC_API
if the download zip does not work, you may have to insert this library manually into your arudino libraries folder

All functions can be seen here if my examples are missing a function you'd like to use:

To add SSID and Password to bot_credintials.h file please copy and paste the following:

#define WIFI_SSID "" 
#define WIFI_PASS ""

Also you may not be able to use the add .zip library function for this library. It's best to download and extract it to your
Arduino libraries folder.

This code is also dependent on the ArduinoWebsockets library. Please be sure to include that in your sketch.
